263,Do you want to use the money from the building fund account?
264,Then you first need permission of Obvion.
265,Have you agreed with Obvion that part of the construction or will you pay for the renovation yourself?
266,Then you must first use your own money.
267,This is what you owe to Obvion prove.
268,Only then can you use the money from the building fund account.
269,"If Obvion deposits the loan or part of it into a building fund account, the following applies:  a. the credit on the building fund account has been pledged to Obvion; b. this pledge serves as security for all claims of Obvion from that loan; c. a credit on the building fund account can only be transferred or pledged to Obvion; d. Obvion may decide not to let you use the money in the building fund account."
270,For example if construction does not proceed according to the construction plan.
271,Do you receive an invoice from the contractor or supplier for the construction or renovation?
272,and are  you agree with that account?
273,Then you can declare that account at Obvion.
274,a. You can claim via www.mijnobvion.nl.
275,We check your claim against the set conditions.
276,"If Obvion agrees with the invoices, we will transfer the amount to your account."
277, In some cases we can transfer the amount to your main contractor at your request to transfer.
278,"During the term of the building fund account, you must also pay monthly interest and/or  make repayments on the part of the loan that has been deposited into the building fund account."
279,"Bee renovation, the full monthly amount will be debited from your account."
280,The monthly We will deposit the interest payment in your building fund account.
281," In the case of new construction, the monthly interest payment is deducted from the monthly amount."
282, The remaining monthly amount will be debited from your account.
283,Do you want to deviate from this?
284,Then you have the following options: a. automatic direct debit of the full monthly amount from your account.
285, We deposit the monthly interest payment into your building fund account.
286," b. full/partial payment of the monthly amount charged to the building fund account,  if interest loss is co-financed."
287,You will receive a monthly interest payment on a credit on the building fund account.
288,The  interest is equal to the interest rate for the loan less 1%.
289,Are there more loan components?
290,"In that case, Obvion uses the weighted average of the interest percentages of the individual loan components (including bridging loan) reduced by 1%."
291,Obvion may cancel the building fund account:    a. when the construction or renovation is finished or stops; b. if you use the money from the building fund account for something other than construction or renovation; c. 2 years after Obvion has deposited the money in the building fund account; d. if you have not used the building fund account for 4 months or longer.
292,"In these cases, Obvion may use the credit of the building fund account for extra repayment of the loan."
293,You do not have to pay a fee for this.
294,Exists your loan from more loan parts?
295,Then Obvion will process this extra refund on the loan part of your choice.
296,Are you not giving a choice to Obvion?
297,Then Obvion determines on which loan component is additionally repaid.
298,"Termination of building fund account and remaining credit:   If there is a balance remaining when your building fund account is terminated, Obvion will use the credit for additional repayment of your loan."
299,Is the remaining credit less than the threshold amount?
300,Then we will transfer the remainder to the account number from which we monthly installment.
301,"Market value adjustment if construction or refurbishment is not completed:  If the construction or renovation stops before it is completed, the construction deposit will be terminated and that which is stated in article 8."
302,Obvion also reduces in a number of cases the market value of your home with the repaid amount.
303, Do you disagree with the reduction in market value?
304,Then you can request a valuation report  to demonstrate the current market value.
305,You will regularly receive an overview of the status of your building fund account.
306,More information can be found in the Construction Depot Signpost.
307,"You can request this from your advisor  or download it from our website, www.obvion.nl."
308,A bridging loan is a loan component with a maximum term of 2 years.
309,"You must repay the bridging loan if you own one of the collateral  transfers, but at the latest at the end of the term of the bridge loan."
310,Obvion determines the interest rate once a month (last working day) and informs  you about this.
311,"If the interest rate changes, your total monthly amount will also change."
312,Therefore you need to have enough room in your budget.
313,This way you can avoid fluctuations in your monthly payments catch.
314,How much financial space you need depends on your personal situation.
315,The interest rate is made up of the following variable components:  a. Basic rate This is the price Obvion pays for buying money to finance mortgages.
316,b. saves Surcharges in connection with developments on the capital markets and capital costs.
317,This surcharge covers the costs of the risks that Obvion runs with the financing of mortgages.
318,"Ongoing costs With this, Obvion covers part of its operating costs, such as housing and  personnel costs."
319, d. Gain.
320,"As a lender, Obvion can add this surcharge to its assets."
321,This states Obvion is also able to finance mortgages for future customers.
322,in addition Obvion thus meets the capital requirements of De Nederlandsche Bank.
323,"Obvion is authorized to change the above components if the developments and/or changes with regard to capital markets and cost of capital, financing risks of mortgages, ongoing charges, operating charges and rate groups its give rise to."
324,The amount of the above components can change monthly.
325,"As a result, the interest rate can also change monthly."
326,"You may always repay the bridging loan extra, without compensation."
327,The bridging loan is not included in determining the amount of the  original principal of the loan.
328,You may repay a maximum of 20% extra per loan component per calendar year without reimbursement of the original principal of that loan component.
329,Obvion calls this the fee-free sum.
330,"Did you not repay anything extra in a calendar year, or only part of this maximum? amount refunded?"
331,"In that case, you may use the (remaining) allowed for that calendar year."
332,additional repayment will not be refunded without compensation in a later calendar year.
333,There may be a minimum amount for an additional (monthly) refund.
334,Obvion  can change this amount during the term of the loan.
335,See “Explanation of the General Terms and Conditions” on obvion.nl for more information.
336,Do you want to repay more than the reimbursement-free sum of the loan component?
337,Then pays  you pay Obvion a compensation for the amount that exceeds this compensation-free sum.
338,This compensation is equal to the present value of the interest loss that Obvion suffers on the amount of the excess.
339,You do not pay more than it actually suffered financial disadvantage that Obvion has as a result of your additional repayment.
340,You only pay a fee if the interest rate that Obvion is paying for the remaining  fixed-rate period at the time of receipt of the additional repayment is lower than the interest rate you pay to Obvion.
341,How is the fee calculated?
342, The following questions are important for the calculation of the compensation:  1.
343,On what part of the amount of the additional refund do you pay compensation? 2.
344,How does Obvion determine the comparative interest?
345,Over which period is the compensation calculated?
346,How does Obvion determine the interest rate differential?
347,How does Obvion calculate the present value?
348, 1: On what part of the amount of the additional refund do you pay a fee?
349, Obvion calculates the compensation that you have to pay on the amount you owe her extra want to repay.
350,The reimbursement-free sum is first deducted from this amount.
351,"How Obvion determines the reimbursement-free sum, can be found in paragraph 1 of this article of this Terms and Conditions."
352," Example:  You want to repay an additional amount of € 40,000."
353,"Your loan consists of one loan component  with an original principal of €175,000."
354,"You may use 20% of the original principal sum of that loan component of € 175,000 per calendar year without additional compensation pay back."
355,"This is € 35,000."
356,"Because the amount you want to repay extra is greater than your reimbursement-free sum, Obvion will calculate a reimbursement of € 5,000 (€ 40,000 - € 35,000)."
357, Have you used (part of) the reimbursement-free sum before in the same calendar year?
358, Then we deduct the reimbursement-free sum used from the total reimbursement-free sum of that calendar year.
359, 2: How does Obvion determine the comparative interest?
360, Obvion then determines the comparative interest per loan component.
361,The comparative interest  Obvion determines on the basis of the interest rate at the time of receipt of the extra repayment is offered by Obvion if the loan part were to be closed again for the remaining fixed-rate period.
362, Obvion looks at how long the fixed-rate period of the loan component on which you repay extra  still running.
363,Obvion then checks whether it offers a fixed-rate period equal to the remaining fixed-rate period of the loan component on which you make additional repayments.
364,"If that if so, then the comparative interest is equal to the interest of that fixed-rate period on the time of receipt of the additional refund."
365,Will the loan be repaid in full?
366,"In that case, the comparative interest is determined on the date on which the final (overall) refund note is issued."
367, Does Obvion not offer a fixed-rate period equal to your remaining fixed-rate period?
368,Then  Obvion uses the highest interest rate offered by Obvion as the comparative interest nearest longer and shorter fixed-rate period.
369," When determining the comparator interest rate, Obvion takes the Obvion Flexible rate and the  variable monthly interest."
370, Example: You have a loan component with an (original) fixed-rate period of 10 years.
371,the interest  for this loan component is 3.8%.
372,You will repay this loan component extra after 3 years and 7 months.
373,The remaining fixed-rate period is then still 6 years and 5 months.
374,A fixed-rate period Obvion does not offer 6 years and 5 months.
375,That's why Obvion looks to the nearest longer and shorter fixed-rate periods that Obvion does offer.
376,"The nearest longer The fixed-rate period is in this case 7 years, with an interest rate of 3.6%."
377,"The nearest shorter  The fixed-rate period is in this case 6 years, with an interest rate of 3.4%."
378,The interest that Obvion used as a comparative interest rate in this example is 3.6%.
379, 3: Over which period is the compensation calculated?
380,"  To determine the period over which the compensation is calculated, Obvion looks at how  the fixed-interest period of the loan component on which you make additional repayments is still ongoing."
381,This we call the remaining fixed-rate period.
382, Obvion calculates the compensation over the remaining fixed-rate period.
383,"Because you a Obvion Mortgage has with the facility Freedom of Interest, the period from Freedom of interest deducted from the remaining fixed-rate period."
384,   Is the end date of the loan component on which you make additional repayments before the end of the fixed-rate period of that loan component minus the period of Freedom of Interest?
385,Dan uses Obvion for the period over which the compensation is calculated the end date of that loan part.
386, 4: How does Obvion determine the interest rate differential?
387,"  To determine the interest rate difference, it is important which mortgage type it is  loan component on which you have made extra repayments."
388,"   Is the loan component on which you make additional repayments an Interest-only, Life or Switch mortgage where there is full investment?"
389, Obvion first calculates the total amount for which you have to pay compensation  interest with your current interest rate.
390,Then Obvion calculates the total interest with the comparative interest.
391,The difference between them is the amount of interest that Obvion does not receive because you pay extra.
392,"     An example of the calculation of the reimbursement for an Interest-Only, Life or You can find a switch mortgage that involves full investment at obvion.nl/fee."
393, Is the loan component on which you make additional repayments an Annuity Mortgage or a Linear mortgage?
394," With an Annuity Mortgage or a Linear Mortgage, Obvion takes into account the  course of the planned future repayments of the amount on which you must pay compensation."
395,"Obvion calculates the total interest over this course using your current interest rate, and the total interest with the comparator interest."
396,The difference between them is amount of interest that Obvion does not receive because you make additional repayments.
397, An example of the calculation of the compensation for an Annuity Mortgage and also An example of a Linear mortgage can be found at obvion.nl/fee.
398," Is the loan component on which you make additional repayments a SpaarGerust, a Spaar, a SpaarGarant or a Switch mortgage that involves savings?"
399," With a SpaarGerust, a Spaar, SpaarGarant or Switch mortgage, no  repaid monthly on the loan."
400,You deposit an amount every month on your SpaarGerust Account or your insurance linked to your SpaarGarrant or SpaarGarant Switch mortgage.
401,"In addition, your current interest on the accrued interest is calculated on a monthly basis savings balance reimbursed and credited to the balance of your SpaarGerust account or your insurance linked to your Spaar-, SpaarGarant- or Switch mortgage."
402,"In front of the calculation of the compensation is the movement of the debt less the accrued savings value of your SpaarGerust, your Spaar, your SpaarGarant or Switch mortgage therefore equal to the movement of the debt balance of an identical Annuity Mortgage."
403,That is why Obvion calculates the compensation in the same way as the compensation for a annuity mortgage.
404,"   An example of the calculation of the reimbursement for a SpaarGerust, a Spaar, a You can find SpaarGarant or a Switch mortgage that involves savings at obvion.nl/ compensation."
405, 5: How does Obvion calculate the present value?
406,"  With an extra repayment, you pay the total interest difference to Obvion in one go, not  in the future but now."
407,That is why we calculate the interest differences per month back to the time of the additional repayment and make this cash.
408,This cash made we add up interest differences and this is then the compensation that Obvion pays you charges.
409,Do you inform Obvion that you want to make an extra repayment?
410,And do you need for the extra refund  pay a fee?
411,Then you will receive a specification of the compensation.
412,In here it is explained for each loan component what the compensation is.
413,"In Article 23 of these General Conditions, you can read how to inform Obvion about an additional refund."
414,You pay the reimbursement at the same time as the additional amount you repay.
415,"After additional repayment, your monthly amount will change."
416,Obvion fits it  monthly amount owed for the loan component to which you make additional repayments.
417,This will take effect on the first working day of the month following the month in which Obvion has received and processed the additional refund.
418,You may repay the loan without compensation in the following cases:  a. you have the home (the collateral to which you are entitled to a mortgage to Obvion  granted) transferred to another person.
419,And You show Obvion that all borrowers move within one year.
420,"Do you transfer the house, or part of it, to: your husband or wife; your registered partner; the person with whom you share a household; a company or partnership in which you participate."
421,"In that case, the exception does NOT apply that you may take the loan extra without compensation  pay back."
422, b. in the event of the death of a borrower up to one year after death after payment of a life insurance policy that is used for additional repayment of the loan.
423,if you repay extra with a payment from a life insurance policy or (bank) savings or investment account pledged to Obvion as security for a loan issued by Obvion to you loan provided.
424,if you make additional repayments with the credit of the building fund account when the building fund account is terminated.
425,e. in the event of complete destruction of the house.
426,f. if you make additional repayments on the day on which the fixed-rate period of the loan component  ends.
427,Obvion will pay interest on an extra repayment from the date of receipt of the extra payment refund until the end of the relevant month.
428,"On the last day of the relevant month, the interest payment is automatically settled with the debt of the loan part on which you pay extra."
429, Do you want to pay extra?
430,Then you must notify Obvion at least 14 days before the desired inform the refund date.
431,You specify the desired repayment date.
432,Do you pay it amount to be refunded later than on the specified refund date?
433,Then you must pay interest on the late repayment.
434,This is called daily interest.
435,"If you make a refund before or on the specified refund date, you will pay from the first no interest on the refunded amount on the day after payment."
436," Obvion may purchase mortgage types, mortgage types, fixed-rate periods and services from the range, add to or change."
437,During the term of the loan you can switch to an Obvion Residential Mortgage  or Obvion Compact Mortgage.
438,Switching to another mortgage type is not possible.
439,Do you want to change your mortgage type as described in paragraph 1?
440,"Then it's not possible  make other adjustments at the same time, such as increasing your loan."

448,A change of mortgage type at the end of the fixed-rate period can lead to a  changed interest rate that corresponds to the chosen mortgage type.
449,A change of mortgage type during the fixed-rate period can lead to a  changed interest rate.
